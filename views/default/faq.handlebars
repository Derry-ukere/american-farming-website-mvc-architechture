						<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix" style="color: white; display: none;">
                <p>Lead by an experienced fourth generation farmer, our team is extremely diligent when it comes to selecting offerings for our platform. We perform due diligence and careful analysis of all offerings prior to offering them to our investors. We do not list any deals that we would not invest in ourselves. In fact, in most offerings, FarmFundr takes an equity position in the deal, only making money if our investors do. That's how much we believe in our offerings.</p>

						<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix" style="color: white; display: none;">
							<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are so many reasons! One of the top reasons for our investors is that allocating some portion of your portfolio to a direct investment in farmland may provide you with a reasonably predictable and stable level of residual income. You are also investing in the most valuable commodity in the world – food!

				<h5 class="et_pb_toggle_title" style="color: white;"> <strong> ARE THESE INVESTMENTS CONSIDERED TO BE RISKY?</strong></h5>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix" style="color: white; display: none;">
<p>You should not view these as risky investments,  riskier than an investment in a stock market index fund, for example. The same is true for any direct investment in real estate. You could lose some or all of your money in any of these investments.					</p>

				<h5 class="et_pb_toggle_title" style="color: white;"> <strong> IF I INVEST IN A PROJECT, DO I BECOME PERSONALLY LIABLE FOR ANYTHING?</strong></h5>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix" style="color: white; display: none;">
            <p> No, not at all. You are personally liable only to make your investment. We choose our legal structures to protect investors from personal liability.					</p>

				<h5 class="et_pb_toggle_title" style="color: white;"> <strong> WHAT IS INCLUDED IN MY INVESTMENT?

				 </strong></h5>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix" style="color: white; display: none;">
					<p>An LLC is formed for each property listed on FarmFundr. As an investor, you own a share in that LLC.

				<h5 class="et_pb_toggle_title" style="color: white;"> <strong> HOW DO I MAKE MONEY?
				 </strong></h5>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix" style="color: white; display: none;">
        <p>At FarmFundr, we do things a little differently so that our investors can realize as much profit from their farm operation as possible. While each offer is structured a bit differently (see individual offerings for full disclosures), generally our model is that you will receive annual returns from the sales of your crop's harvest in addition to the appreciation from ownership of the land.					</p>

				<h5 class="et_pb_toggle_title" style="color: white;"> <strong> HOW AM I AFFECTED IF FARMFUNDR HAS BUSINESS ISSUES?
				 </strong></h5>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix" style="color: white; display: none;">
         <p> Since your investment results in the ownership of a share of an LLC setup for the farmland entity, you will retain your legal ownership, regardless of any business issues FarmFundr, LLC. may have. Our business model was created with our investors's security and best interest top of mind.					</p>

				<h5 class="et_pb_toggle_title" style="color: white;"> <strong> WHAT TYPE OF TAX FORM WILL I RECEIVE?
				 </strong></h5>
				<div class="et_pb_toggle_content clearfix" style="color: white; display: none;">
         <p> You will receive a K-1 tax form. It will provide you with detailed information on your share of the partnership's taxable income. Partnerships are generally not subject to federal or state income tax, but instead issue a K-1 to each investor to report his or her share of the partnership’s income, gains, losses, deductions and credits. The K-1s are provided to investors on an annual basis so that each investor can include K-1 amounts on his or her tax return.					</p>
